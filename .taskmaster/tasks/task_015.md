**Title:** Review & Update Level 14: String Methods

**Status:** done

**Dependencies:** 14 ✓

**Priority:** high

**Description:** Review and improve Level 14 to ensure it properly teaches string methods, building on method knowledge from arrays.

**Details:**

Assess and improve Level 14:

Current state:
- Title: String Methods
- Task: Convert text to uppercase
- Expected Output: 'JAVASCRIPT PROGRAMMING'

Review checklist:
1. Does it connect to array methods (Level 10)?
2. Does it explain strings have methods too?
3. Does it explain toUpperCase() specifically?
4. Does it mention other useful string methods?

Ensure:
- Connect to method concept from Level 10
- Explain strings are also objects with methods
- Show that toUpperCase() returns a new string
- Mention toLowerCase(), trim(), split(), etc.

Good placement - reinforces methods concept on different data type.

**Test Strategy:**

1. Verify connection to array methods is made
2. Check toUpperCase() is explained
3. Ensure other methods are mentioned
4. Test solution works correctly
