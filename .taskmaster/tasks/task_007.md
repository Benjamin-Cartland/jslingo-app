**Title:** Review & Update Level 6: Conditionals

**Status:** done

**Dependencies:** 6 ✓

**Priority:** high

**Description:** Review and improve Level 6 to ensure it properly teaches if statements, building on all prior concepts.

**Details:**

Assess and improve Level 6:

Current state:
- Title: Conditionals
- Task: Check if 10 > 5, print message
- Expected Output: 'Yes, 10 is greater than 5'

Review checklist:
1. Does it explain what conditionals are?
2. Does it explain the if statement syntax?
3. Does it explain comparison operators (>, <, ===)?
4. Does it explain curly braces for code blocks?
5. Does it explain boolean expressions?

This is a BIG jump in complexity. Ensure:
- Thorough explanation of if syntax
- Explain what happens when condition is false
- Consider introducing else in same or next level
- Make sure curly braces are explained

Build on previous:
- Use variables in the condition
- Combine with math knowledge

**Test Strategy:**

1. Verify if statement syntax is clearly explained
2. Check that boolean logic is introduced
3. Ensure not too big of a jump from Level 5
4. Test as beginner - is the concept clear?
