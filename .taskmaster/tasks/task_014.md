# Task ID: 14

**Title:** Review & Update Level 13: Objects

**Status:** pending

**Dependencies:** 13

**Priority:** high

**Description:** Review and improve Level 13 to ensure it properly introduces JavaScript objects.

**Details:**

Assess and improve Level 13:

Current state:
- Title: Dictionaries (should be 'Objects')
- Task: Create person object, access name property
- Expected Output: 'Alice'

Review checklist:
1. Does it explain what objects are?
2. Does it explain key-value pairs?
3. Does it explain property access with dot notation?
4. Does it connect to arrays (both store data)?

CRITICAL: Rename from 'Dictionaries' to 'Objects'!
- 'Dictionary' is Python terminology
- JavaScript uses 'Object'

Ensure:
- Explain {} syntax for objects
- Explain key: value format
- Show both dot notation and bracket notation
- Compare to arrays (indexed vs named)

Consider:
- Nested objects (maybe too advanced)
- Methods on objects (functions as values)

**Test Strategy:**

1. Verify renamed to 'Objects' not 'Dictionaries'
2. Check object syntax is explained
3. Ensure dot notation access is clear
4. Test solution works correctly
