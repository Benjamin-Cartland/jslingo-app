**Title:** Review & Update Level 3: String Variables

**Status:** pending

**Dependencies:** 3

**Priority:** high

**Description:** Review and improve Level 3 to ensure it properly teaches string variables and template literals, building on previous levels.

**Details:**

Assess and improve Level 3:

Current state:
- Title: String Variables
- Task: Create variable 'name' with value 'JavaScript'
- Expected Output: 'Hello, JavaScript!'
- Uses template literals: `Hello, ${name}!`

Review checklist:
1. Does it explain strings vs numbers?
2. Does it introduce template literals clearly?
3. Is the ${} syntax explained?
4. Does it build on variable knowledge from Level 2?

CONCERN: Template literals might be too advanced this early
Options:
- Keep but explain thoroughly
- Simplify to string concatenation first
- Keep template literals but make explanation very clear

Ensure progression:
- Level 1: console.log, strings in quotes
- Level 2: variables with numbers
- Level 3: variables with strings + combining strings

**Test Strategy:**

1. Verify description explains strings clearly
2. Check template literal syntax is well explained
3. Ensure builds on Levels 1-2
4. Test as a beginner - is it too confusing?
