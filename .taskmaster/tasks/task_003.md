**Title:** Review & Update Level 2: Variables (Numbers)

**Status:** pending

**Dependencies:** 2

**Priority:** high

**Description:** Review and improve Level 2 to ensure it properly teaches variables and the 'let' keyword, building on Level 1's console.log knowledge.

**Details:**

Assess and improve Level 2:

Current state:
- Title: Variables (Numbers)
- Task: Create a variable called 'age' with value 25
- Expected Output: '25'

Review checklist:
1. Does it explain what a variable is (named container for data)?
2. Does it explain 'let' keyword and why we use it?
3. Does it build on Level 1 by using console.log to display?
4. Is the variable name 'age' relatable and clear?
5. Does it explain that numbers don't need quotes?

Ensure progression:
- Level 1 taught: console.log() and strings
- Level 2 should: introduce variables + numbers, reinforce console.log

Consider adding:
- Explanation of why variables are useful
- Difference between 'let' and 'const' (briefly)
- Why we don't use quotes around numbers

**Test Strategy:**

1. Verify builds naturally on Level 1 concepts
2. Check description teaches variables clearly
3. Ensure hint reinforces both variable and logging concepts
4. Test solution works correctly
