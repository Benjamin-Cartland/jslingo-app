**Title:** Review & Update Level 10: Array Operations

**Status:** done

**Dependencies:** 10 ✓

**Priority:** high

**Description:** Review and improve Level 10 to ensure it properly teaches array methods like push().

**Details:**

Assess and improve Level 10:

Current state:
- Title: List Operations (should be 'Array Methods')
- Task: Add 4 to array [1,2,3]
- Expected Output: '[1,2,3,4]'

Review checklist:
1. Does it introduce the concept of methods?
2. Does it explain .push() syntax?
3. Does it explain that push modifies the original array?
4. Does it mention other common methods?

This is first introduction to methods!

Ensure:
- Explain what a method is (function attached to object)
- Explain the dot notation
- Mention push adds to END of array
- Preview other methods (pop, shift, unshift)

Consider:
- Renaming to 'Array Methods'
- Explaining return values
- Connecting to logging arrays

**Test Strategy:**

1. Verify method concept is introduced
2. Check push() is explained clearly
3. Ensure dot notation is explained
4. Test solution produces correct output format
