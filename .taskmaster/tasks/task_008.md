**Title:** Review & Update Level 7: For Loops

**Status:** done

**Dependencies:** 7 ✓

**Priority:** high

**Description:** Review and improve Level 7 to ensure it properly teaches for loops, building on conditional knowledge.

**Details:**

Assess and improve Level 7:

Current state:
- Title: For Loops
- Task: Print 1, 2, 3 using a for loop
- Expected Output: '1\n2\n3'

Review checklist:
1. Does it explain what loops are (repeating code)?
2. Does it break down the for loop syntax:
   - Initialization (let i = 1)
   - Condition (i <= 3)
   - Increment (i++)
3. Does it explain i++ shorthand?
4. Does it connect to conditionals (the middle part)?

This is another complex concept. Ensure:
- Clear explanation of each part of for loop
- Why loops are useful (don't repeat yourself)
- What happens step by step

Consider:
- Adding a visual or step-by-step walkthrough
- Explaining common loop patterns
- Connecting to previous conditional knowledge

**Test Strategy:**

1. Verify for loop syntax is broken down clearly
2. Check each part (init, condition, increment) is explained
3. Ensure builds on conditional knowledge
4. Test solution produces correct output
