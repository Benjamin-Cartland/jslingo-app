# Task ID: 5

**Title:** Review & Update Level 4: User Input

**Status:** pending

**Dependencies:** 4

**Priority:** high

**Description:** Review and improve Level 4 to ensure the 'User Input' concept is appropriate and builds on prior levels.

**Details:**

Assess and improve Level 4:

Current state:
- Title: User Input
- Task: Create color variable, output 'Your favorite color is blue'
- Expected Output: 'Your favorite color is blue'

CONCERN: This level is confusingly named 'User Input' but doesn't actually take user input - it just uses another template literal.

Options:
1. Rename to something more accurate ('More Template Literals', 'String Interpolation')
2. Change the exercise to be meaningfully different from Level 3
3. Replace with a different concept entirely

This level feels redundant with Level 3. Consider:
- Teaching string concatenation with + operator
- Teaching multiple variables in one template literal
- Moving to a different concept (boolean variables?)

Ensure meaningful progression from Level 3.

**Test Strategy:**

1. Assess if this level teaches something new
2. Verify it's not too similar to Level 3
3. Ensure title matches actual content
4. Test learning progression makes sense
