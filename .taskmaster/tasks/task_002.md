# Task ID: 2

**Title:** Review & Update Level 1: Hello World

**Status:** done

**Dependencies:** 1 ✓

**Priority:** high

**Description:** Review and improve Level 1 (Hello World) to ensure it properly introduces console.log() and doesn't assume prior knowledge.

**Details:**

Assess and improve Level 1:

Current state:
- Title: Hello World
- Task: Use console.log() to print 'Hello, World!'
- Expected Output: 'Hello, World!'

Review checklist:
1. Does the description explain what console.log() is?
2. Does it explain why we use it (seeing output)?
3. Does it explain the syntax (parentheses, quotes for strings)?
4. Is the task clear for someone who has never coded?
5. Is the hint helpful without giving away the answer?
6. Does the starter code comment guide without confusing?

Consider adding:
- Brief explanation of what JavaScript is
- What 'printing' or 'logging' means
- Why quotes are needed around text
- That semicolons are optional but good practice

This is the foundation - users should feel confident after completing it.

**Test Strategy:**

1. Read through all level content as a complete beginner
2. Verify description explains the concept clearly
3. Test that hint helps without spoiling
4. Ensure solution matches expected output
5. Verify translations are updated
