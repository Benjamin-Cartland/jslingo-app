**Title:** Review & Update Level 11: Functions Basics

**Status:** pending

**Dependencies:** 11

**Priority:** high

**Description:** Review and improve Level 11 to ensure it properly introduces function declaration and calling.

**Details:**

Assess and improve Level 11:

Current state:
- Title: Functions Basics
- Task: Create greet() function that logs 'Hello!'
- Expected Output: 'Hello!'

Review checklist:
1. Does it explain what functions are (reusable code)?
2. Does it explain the function keyword?
3. Does it explain function naming conventions?
4. Does it explain calling vs defining?
5. Does it explain the parentheses?

Functions are a MAJOR concept!

Ensure:
- Clear distinction between defining and calling
- Explain why functions are useful (DRY)
- Simple example that's easy to understand
- Mention that functions can be called multiple times

Make sure solution requires both:
1. Defining the function
2. Calling the function

**Test Strategy:**

1. Verify function concept is well explained
2. Check define vs call distinction is clear
3. Ensure syntax is broken down
4. Test solution includes both definition and call
