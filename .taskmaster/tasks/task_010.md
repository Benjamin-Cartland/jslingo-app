**Title:** Review & Update Level 9: Arrays Basics

**Status:** pending

**Dependencies:** 9

**Priority:** high

**Description:** Review and improve Level 9 to ensure it properly introduces arrays and indexing.

**Details:**

Assess and improve Level 9:

Current state:
- Title: Lists Basics (should be 'Arrays')
- Task: Create fruits array, access second element
- Expected Output: 'banana'

Review checklist:
1. Does it explain what arrays are?
2. Does it explain the [] syntax?
3. Does it explain zero-based indexing (CRITICAL)?
4. Why is index 1 the second item?

Zero-based indexing is a major stumbling block!

Ensure:
- Very clear explanation of indexing starting at 0
- Visual representation if possible
- fruits[0] = 'apple', fruits[1] = 'banana', etc.

Consider:
- Renaming from 'Lists' to 'Arrays' (JS terminology)
- Adding more context about why arrays exist
- Connecting to loops (preview: iterate over arrays)

**Test Strategy:**

1. Verify zero-indexing is VERY clearly explained
2. Check array syntax is shown properly
3. Ensure title matches JS terminology
4. Test as beginner - is indexing clear?
