**Title:** Review & Update Level 8: While Loops

**Status:** done

**Dependencies:** 8 ✓

**Priority:** high

**Description:** Review and improve Level 8 to ensure it properly teaches while loops as an alternative to for loops.

**Details:**

Assess and improve Level 8:

Current state:
- Title: While Loops
- Task: Print 1, 2, 3 using a while loop
- Expected Output: '1\n2\n3'

Review checklist:
1. Does it explain how while differs from for?
2. Does it explain the while syntax?
3. Does it warn about infinite loops?
4. Does it explain when to use while vs for?

Ensure progression:
- Level 7 taught for loops
- Level 8 should show while as alternative
- Explain: while is better when you don't know iterations in advance

CONCERN: Same output as Level 7 might be confusing

Consider:
- Different example that showcases while better
- Explain the mental model difference
- Warn about forgetting to increment (infinite loop)

**Test Strategy:**

1. Verify while loop syntax is explained
2. Check comparison to for loop is clear
3. Ensure infinite loop danger is mentioned
4. Test solution works correctly
